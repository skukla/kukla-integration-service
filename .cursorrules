# Adobe App Builder - Kukla Integration Service

## Project Overview

This is an Adobe App Builder application that integrates with Adobe Commerce for product data management and file operations. The project uses a staging-first development approach with HTMX for frontend interactions.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Platform**: Adobe App Builder (Node.js serverless)
- **Frontend**: HTMX with vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Adobe I/O Runtime actions
- **Commerce**: Adobe Commerce integration
- **File Storage**: Adobe I/O Files SDK
- **Build Tool**: Adobe I/O CLI
- **Deployment**: Staging and Production workspaces

## Code Style & Standards

- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Follow Adobe's coding standards
- Use async/await for promises
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use JSDoc for function documentation
- Follow the existing project structure

## Project Structure Rules

- **actions/**: Backend serverless functions
  - `backend/`: API endpoints and data processing
  - `frontend/`: HTMX response handlers
- **src/**: Shared utilities and core logic
  - `core/`: Common utilities
  - `htmx/`: HTMX-specific helpers
  - `commerce/`: Adobe Commerce integration
- **web-src/**: Frontend static assets
- **config/**: Environment and schema configurations
- **docs/**: Comprehensive documentation

## Development Guidelines

### Always Start with Context

Before implementing any feature:

1. Check existing utilities in `src/core/` first
2. Review similar patterns in `actions/backend/` or `actions/frontend/`
3. Consult relevant documentation in `docs/`
4. Verify the configuration system in `config/`

### Adobe App Builder Specific

- All backend code goes in `actions/` as Adobe I/O Runtime functions
- Use Adobe I/O SDK features (@adobe/aio-sdk)
- Leverage Adobe I/O Files for file operations
- Use environment-specific configurations from `config/environments/`
- Follow staging-first development workflow

### HTMX Integration

- Use HTMX attributes for dynamic UI updates
- Keep JavaScript minimal and progressive enhancement focused
- Use the established HTMX utilities in `src/htmx/`
- Ensure graceful fallbacks when JavaScript is disabled

### Commerce Integration

- Use the established Commerce utilities in `src/commerce/`
- Handle Commerce API rate limits appropriately
- Validate product data according to Commerce schemas
- Use proper error handling for Commerce API calls

### Error Handling

- Use consistent error response formats
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Follow the error handling patterns in existing code

### Performance

- Use caching where appropriate
- Optimize Commerce API calls
- Consider file size limits for Adobe I/O Files
- Use compression for large responses

### Testing

- Use the existing test scripts (`npm run test:action`)
- Test actions individually before integration
- Use performance testing scripts for optimization
- Test in staging environment before production

## Code Quality

- Use ESLint and Prettier (already configured)
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully

## Security

- Never commit credentials or secrets
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all inputs
- Follow Adobe's security best practices
- Use the security guidelines in `docs/security.md`

## Deployment

- Use `npm start` for quick development iteration
- Use `npm run deploy` for reliable staging deployment
- Use `npm run deploy:prod` for production
- Always test in staging before production deployment

## Context-Aware Development

When helping with this project:

1. **Reference actual files**: Always check what exists in the current directory structure
2. **Follow established patterns**: Use the same coding style and architecture patterns found in existing files
3. **Maintain consistency**: Keep the same error handling, logging, and response formats
4. **Use existing utilities**: Don't recreate functionality that already exists in `src/core/`
5. **Update documentation**: When adding features, update relevant docs in `docs/`

## Memory Substitutes (Manual Context)

Since automatic memories aren't available, use these manual techniques:

- **Reference previous solutions**: "Like the pattern in actions/backend/get-products.js..."
- **Point to documentation**: "Following the security guidelines in docs/security.md..."
- **Use project structure**: "Create a new utility in src/core/ that can be shared..."
- **Include version context**: "This is an Adobe App Builder project using staging-first development..."

## When Making Changes

1. Check existing utilities in `src/core/` before creating new ones
2. Follow the configuration system for new settings
3. Update documentation when adding features
4. Test with the provided test scripts
5. Use staging environment for development
6. Consider HTMX patterns for UI interactions
7. Follow the established project patterns and conventions

## Common Patterns

- Configuration: Use the schema-validated config system
- File Operations: Use Adobe I/O Files SDK through existing utilities
- Commerce API: Use established Commerce integration patterns
- Frontend Updates: Use HTMX for dynamic content
- Error Responses: Use consistent error formatting
- Logging: Use appropriate log levels and formatting

## Dependencies

- Prefer using existing dependencies over adding new ones
- Use Adobe SDK features when available
- Keep dependencies updated and secure
- Document any new dependency requirements

## Conversation Context Helpers

To help maintain context across conversations:

- Always mention this is an "Adobe App Builder Commerce integration project"
- Reference the staging-first development workflow when discussing deployment
- Point to existing documentation when relevant
- Use the project structure terminology consistently
- Reference the existing test scripts when discussing testing
