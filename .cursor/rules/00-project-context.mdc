# Adobe App Builder - Kukla Integration Service

## Project Overview
This is an Adobe App Builder application that integrates with Adobe Commerce for product data management and file operations. The project uses a staging-first development approach with HTMX for frontend interactions.

## Architecture & Technology Stack
- **Platform**: Adobe App Builder (Node.js serverless)
- **Frontend**: HTMX with vanilla JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Adobe I/O Runtime actions
- **Commerce**: Adobe Commerce integration
- **File Storage**: Adobe I/O Files SDK
- **Build Tool**: Adobe I/O CLI
- **Deployment**: Staging and Production workspaces

## Project Structure
- **actions/**: Backend serverless functions
  - `backend/`: API endpoints and data processing
  - `frontend/`: HTMX response handlers
- **src/**: Shared utilities and core logic
  - `core/`: Common utilities
  - `htmx/`: HTMX-specific helpers  
  - `commerce/`: Adobe Commerce integration
- **web-src/**: Frontend static assets
- **config/**: Environment and schema configurations
- **docs/**: Comprehensive documentation

## Development Workflow
- Use staging-first development approach
- Deploy with `npm start` (quick) or `npm run deploy` (reliable)
- Test individual actions with `npm run test:action [action-name]`
- Always test in staging before production deployment
