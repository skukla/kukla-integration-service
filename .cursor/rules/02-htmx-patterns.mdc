# HTMX Integration Patterns

## HTMX Best Practices
- Use HTMX attributes for dynamic UI updates
- Keep JavaScript minimal and progressive enhancement focused
- Use the established HTMX utilities in `src/htmx/`
- Ensure graceful fallbacks when JavaScript is disabled

## Frontend Response Patterns
- Actions in `actions/frontend/` should return HTMX-compatible responses
- Use consistent HTMX response formatting
- Leverage existing HTMX utilities for response generation

## Progressive Enhancement
- Start with working HTML
- Layer on HTMX for dynamic behavior
- Add minimal JavaScript only when necessary
- Ensure functionality works without JavaScript
