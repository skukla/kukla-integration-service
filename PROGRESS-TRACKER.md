- [x] **Plan final naming strategy** - Established production-ready naming approach

### **✅ PHASE 2: Main Scripts (100% Complete)**

- [x] **Refactor `scripts/test.js`** to Light DDD pattern ✅ **BEAUTIFUL OUTPUT RESTORED**
- [x] **Refactor `scripts/build.js`** to Light DDD pattern ✅ **DONE**
- [x] **Create thin entry points** that delegate to domain workflows ✅ **DONE**

### **✅ PHASE 3: Domain Workflows (100% Complete)**

- [x] **Create clean orchestrator workflows** in deploy domain ✅ **DONE**
- [x] **Move business logic** from main scripts to domain workflows ✅ **DONE**
- [x] **Implement consistent error handling** and return formats ✅ **DONE**

### **✅ PHASE 4: Remove Over-Engineering (100% Complete)**

- [x] **Remove complex format domain** abstraction chains ✅ **ENTIRE DIRECTORY DELETED**
- [x] **Eliminate unnecessary workflow orchestration** for simple operations ✅ **DONE**
- [x] **Replace complex operations** with direct functions ✅ **DONE**

### **⏳ PHASE 4.5: Final Production Names (0% Complete)**

- [ ] **Rename files to final production names**
  - `app-deployment-simple.js` → `app-deployment.js`
  - `deploy-proper.js` → `deploy.js`
- [ ] **Remove all "refactoring" references** in comments
- [ ] **Treat Light DDD as established approach**

### **⏳ PHASE 5: Cleanup Obsolete Files (0% Complete)**

- [ ] **Delete entire `scripts/format/` directory** (9-layer abstraction chains)
- [ ] **Remove complex workflow files** replaced by clean orchestrators
- [ ] **Delete unnecessary utility files** consolidated into `scripts/core/`

### **⏳ PHASE 6: Testing & Validation (0% Complete)**

- [ ] **Test all refactored scripts** functionality
- [ ] **Verify visual output** matches original clean style
- [ ] **Audit against Light DDD standards**
- [ ] **Fix broken functionality** (like mesh-400 error)

## 🔧 **What We've Built So Far**

### **✅ Light DDD Foundation**

```text
scripts/
├── core/
│   ├── formatting.js     ✅ Clean formatting functions
│   └── args.js           ✅ Shared argument parsing
├── deploy/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── app-deployment-simple.js  ✅ Clean orchestrator example
└── deploy-proper.js      ✅ Thin entry point example
```

### **✅ Documentation & Standards**

- **`docs/development/scripts-architecture.md`** - Complete Light DDD guide
- **`SCRIPTS-REFACTORING-PLAN.md`** - Comprehensive refactoring plan
- **Audit standards** - Clear good vs bad patterns
- **Migration strategy** - Step-by-step implementation guide

### **✅ Examples & Patterns**

- **Main script pattern** - Thin entry point with clean delegation
- **Domain workflow pattern** - Clean orchestrator with step-by-step execution
- **Shared utilities pattern** - Simple, reusable functions
- **Formatting pattern** - Direct functions like `format.success()` and `format.error()`

// Before (Over-engineered)
console.log(await format.deployStart(environment));
console.log(await format.meshDone(environment));

// After (Clean Light DDD)
console.log(format.success('Environment detected: staging'));
console.log(format.status('SUCCESS', 200));
```
