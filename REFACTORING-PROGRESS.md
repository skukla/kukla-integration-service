## Metrics & Success Tracking

### Code Reduction Metrics

- **Before**: ~4000 lines of code
- **Target After**: ~800 lines of code  
- **Current**: [Update as progress made]

### File Count Reduction

- **Before**: ~200 files
- **Target After**: ~40 files
- **Current**: [Update as progress made]

### Performance Targets

- **Action Response Time**: <200ms (vs current ~300ms)
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB (vs current ~80MB)
- **Build Time**: <30s (vs current ~60s)

## Risk Tracking

### High Risk Items

- [ ] **API Mesh Functionality**: Ensure mesh resolvers continue working
- [ ] **HTMX Integration**: Preserve frontend functionality
- [ ] **File Storage**: Maintain compatibility with existing files
- [ ] **Commerce Integration**: Preserve authentication patterns

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Incremental Changes**: One action at a time
- **Comprehensive Testing**: After each phase
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep original implementation accessible
- **Staging Validation**: Full testing before production

## Notes & Decisions

### Week 1 Notes

**Completed**:

- ✅ Created `actions/utils.js` with Adobe standard utilities (errorResponse, checkMissingRequestInputs, etc.)
- ✅ Converted all 5 actions to Adobe standard patterns:
  - `get-products/index.js`: Now uses `exports.main`, `@adobe/aio-sdk` Core.Logger, preserved business logic
  - `get-products-mesh/index.js`: Converted to Adobe pattern, preserved API Mesh functionality
  - `browse-files/index.js`: Converted to Adobe pattern, preserved HTMX file browser functionality  
  - `delete-file/index.js`: Converted to Adobe pattern, preserved HTMX file operations
  - `download-file/index.js`: Converted to Adobe pattern, preserved file download workflows
- ✅ **Phase 2A Completed**: Simplified storage operations
  - Created `actions/storage.js` - Direct storage operations (110 lines vs 1000+ lines of abstractions)
  - Replaced `storeCsvFile` (6+ abstraction layers) with `storeCsv` (direct calls)
  - Updated all actions to use simplified storage functions
  - **Eliminated**: Strategy patterns, factory patterns, response builders, orchestration layers

**Key Decisions**:

1. **Preserved Business Logic**: Kept valuable functions like `buildProducts`, `createCsv`, mesh integration
2. **Maintained HTMX**: All HTMX functionality preserved in browse-files and delete-file actions
3. **Adobe Standard Response Format**: Actions now return proper `{ statusCode, body }` format
4. **Direct Parameter Access**: Actions use `params.VARIABLE_NAME` instead of context extraction
5. **Eliminated Over-Engineering**: Removed 6+ storage abstraction layers, replaced with direct SDK calls

**Storage Simplification Summary**:

- **Before**: `storeCsvFile` → 6 dependencies → strategy factory → operations → response builders → utilities
- **After**: `storeCsv` → Direct Adobe I/O Files or AWS S3 SDK calls
- **Code Reduction**: ~90% reduction in storage-related code complexity

- ✅ **Phase 2B Completed**: Config system simplification
  - Replaced `config/domains/` (12 files, 500+ lines) with single `config.js` (67 lines)
  - Eliminated complex domain orchestration, validation systems, environment handling
  - **Eliminated**: Domain builders, validation layers, orchestration patterns

- ✅ **Phase 2C Completed**: Business logic simplification  
  - Created `actions/csv.js` - Direct CSV generation (85 lines) vs streaming/fallback complexity
  - Created `actions/htmx.js` - Direct HTML generation vs over-engineered routing/response builders
  - Updated all actions to use simplified utilities
  - **Eliminated**: Streaming abstractions, fallback systems, routing complexities, response builders

**Architecture Transformation Summary**:

- **Before**: 5 actions → 2000+ lines of infrastructure → business logic
- **After**: 5 actions → 300 lines of simple utilities → business logic  
- **Infrastructure reduction**: ~85% elimination of abstraction layers
- **Patterns eliminated**: Factories, strategies, orchestrators, builders, validators, routers

**Files Created (Simple Utilities)**:

- `actions/utils.js` (Adobe standard utilities)
- `actions/storage.js` (Direct storage operations)  
- `actions/csv.js` (Direct CSV generation)
- `actions/htmx.js` (Direct HTML generation)
- `config.js` (Single configuration file)

**Major Systems Simplified**:

1. **Storage**: 6+ abstraction layers → Direct SDK calls
2. **Config**: 12 domain files → Single config object  
3. **CSV**: Streaming/compression system → Direct string generation
4. **HTMX**: Complex routing/builders → Direct HTML functions
5. **Actions**: Factory patterns → Adobe standard `exports.main`

**Next Steps**:

- Remove unused infrastructure files and directories
- Final cleanup and validation
