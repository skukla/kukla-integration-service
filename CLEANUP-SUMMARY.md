- ✅ `docs/development/design-system.md` - Frontend patterns
- ✅ `docs/development/frontend.md` - HTMX patterns

## ✅ Configuration Updates

### .cursorrules Replacement

- ❌ Moved `.cursorrules` → `.cursorrules-legacy` (backup)
- ✅ Replaced with refactor-focused `.cursorrules` (Adobe patterns only)
- **Size Reduction**: 1400+ lines → 150 lines focused on Adobe standards

### README.md Update

- ✅ Added prominent refactoring notice
- ✅ Links to tracking documents
- ✅ Clear goal statement (80% code reduction)

## 📊 Cleanup Results

### Documentation Reduction

- **Before**: 26 documentation files
- **After**: 17 documentation files  
- **Reduction**: 35% fewer docs to maintain during refactoring

### Focus Achievement

- ❌ **Removed**: All conflicting patterns (OAuth, action factories, strategy patterns)
- ✅ **Kept**: All valuable patterns (HTMX, mesh, performance, setup)
- ✅ **Aligned**: All remaining docs support Adobe standards migration

### Development Environment  

- ✅ **Clear Guidelines**: .cursorrules now shows Adobe patterns only
- ✅ **No Conflicts**: Developers won't see conflicting documentation
- ✅ **Focused**: All remaining docs support the refactoring effort

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with Adobe standard action pattern implementation
2. **Use REFACTORING-PROGRESS.md**: Track detailed progress through 4-week plan
3. **Update Remaining Docs**: As code changes, update the 17 remaining docs
4. **Follow .cursorrules**: Use Adobe patterns consistently
