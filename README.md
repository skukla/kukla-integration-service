## Key Features

- **Product Management** - Export and manage Adobe Commerce product data
- **File Operations** - Secure file storage and handling
- **Simple Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns with focused components
- **HTMX Integration** - Dynamic UI updates without complex JavaScript
- **Performance Optimized** - Caching, compression, and efficient resource usage
- **Flexible Configuration** - Environment-aware settings with validation

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**

- Node.js 18+
- Adobe Developer Console access
- Adobe Commerce instance
- Adobe I/O CLI

2. **Installation**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kukla-integration-service
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

The application uses a comprehensive configuration system:

- Environment-specific settings in `config/environments/`
- Default values in `config/defaults/`
- Schema validation for all settings
- See [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) for details

4. **Development**

   This App Builder application uses staging workspace for all development.

   ### Prerequisites

   1. **Adobe I/O Project**: Configure your project with proper credentials
   2. **AIO CLI**: Install and configure with your credentials
   3. **Workspace**: Set up staging workspace with Files SDK access

   ### Development Workflow

   ```bash
   # Quick development cycle
   npm start                   # Generates frontend assets + fast deploy to staging

   # Reliable deployment
   npm run deploy              # Generates frontend assets + clean deploy to staging
   npm run deploy:prod         # Generates frontend assets + clean deploy to production
   ```

   ### Why Staging-Only Development?

   Adobe I/O Files SDK requires proper credentials and runs best in Adobe's environment. By developing directly on staging:

   - ✅ **Reliable**: No local server proxy issues
   - ✅ **Real Environment**: Identical to production
   - ✅ **Team Friendly**: Everyone accesses the same staging URL
   - ✅ **Fast**: Adobe's deployment is quick enough for development
   - ✅ **Simple**: One environment, one URL

   ### Key URLs

   - **Staging App**: Check Adobe Developer Console after `npm start`
   - **Adobe Experience Platform**: Links provided during deployment

   ### Development Process

   1. Make your changes locally
   2. Run `npm start` for quick testing or `npm run deploy` for reliable deployment
   3. Test your changes on the staging URL
   4. Repeat until ready for production
   5. Deploy to production with `npm run deploy:prod`

**Key Architecture Features:**

- **True Mesh Pattern**: API Mesh consolidates data from multiple Commerce APIs into single GraphQL query
- **Step Functions**: Reusable action components (DRY principle)
- **Configuration System**: Environment-aware with schema validation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: HTMX-first frontend with minimal JavaScript

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Quick Development
npm start                    # Fast deploy to staging (no clean)

# Reliable Deployment
npm run deploy              # Clean build and deploy to staging
npm run deploy:prod         # Clean build and deploy to production

# Building and Utilities
npm run build               # Build application only
npm run build:config        # Generate frontend configuration and URL modules
npm run clean               # Clean build artifacts

# Testing
npm run test:action         # Test individual actions
npm run test:perf           # Performance testing (staging)
npm run test:perf:prod      # Performance testing (production)
```

### Simplified Workflow

Our development approach uses staging workspace for all development:

1. **Quick Development**: `npm start` - Fast deploy for iteration
2. **Reliable Deploy**: `npm run deploy` - Clean deploy to staging
3. **Production**: `npm run deploy:prod` - Clean deploy to production

**Why staging-only?** Adobe I/O Files SDK requires proper credentials and works best in Adobe's environment. This approach eliminates local development complexity while providing a fast, reliable development experience.

### Testing Individual Actions

```bash
# Enhanced mode (default) - shows formatted output with spinners
npm run test:action get-products
npm run test:action browse-files

# Raw mode - outputs pure JSON for scripting/automation
npm run test:action get-products -- --raw
npm run test:action browse-files -- --raw

# Show available actions
npm run test:action
```
