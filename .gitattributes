# Documentation files
# When merging from docs/current into feature branches, take their version

# Ensure text files have normalized line endings

# Explain merge strategies in comments
# merge=theirs: During merge conflicts, automatically take the version from the branch we're merging from
# This ensures docs/current remains the source of truth when we merge it into feature branches
